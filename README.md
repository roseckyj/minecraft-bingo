## Usage
To start playing you need to[ **install the datapack**](https://www.planetminecraft.com/blog/how-to-download-and-install-minecraft-data-packs/) and then **run the** ***script.py*** using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This will generate advancements for your bingo game. You will be prompted to select difficulty and worlds you want to include. The difficulties are AI generated, so they might not be perfect. You can just spam enter key to include all the items.

Inspired by Swiep's [Minecraft Bingo Datapack](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/f7iwat/hi_we_made_a_minecraft_bingo_datapack_for_115/) the game gets started by **getting a dirt block** and the board can later be accessed by **pressing L** to open advancements. You need to complete either a full row, or a full column in order to win the game.

You can play with this datapack in singleplayer or multiplayer. Feel free to redistribute or modify the datapack (or update it for future versions), just don't forget to mention the source. Also recording or streaming with this datapack is encouraged, just tag the source so others can find it.
